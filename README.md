Data source: Kaggle
Main accomplishments:
Performed exploratory data analysis and examined feature correlations in boxplots, countplots and
heatmaps; Utilized one-hot encoding on geography feature; Used stratified sampling and standardization
to get suitable train and test sets
Trained and evaluated classifiers of random forests, logistic regression, KNN through grid search cross
validation; Selected a promising model from random forests with highest cross validation accuracy (0.863);
Constructed confusion matrix and calculated accuracy, precision and recall of test set with each classifier;
Proved that the previously selected model gained highest AUC score (0.8343) by comparing RUC curves
of different classifiers
